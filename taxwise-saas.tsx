Every person earning income above the threshold, every registered business, and every employer must comply with Uganda's tax laws or face penalties and interest." },

If they fail to respond within 90 days, the taxpayer may proceed directly to TAT treating the silence as a deemed refusal.\n\n**Deposit Requirement:** Where the assessment is above UGX 50 million, URA may require a deposit of **30% of the disputed tax** before the objection is heard." },
